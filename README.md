# Unusual-Activity-Detection-Project_ML
This project aims to detect unusual activities in a video like running around or fights
A machine learning model is trained to achieve this purpose
First of all multiple screenshots of videos are taken .
Then humans are identified from the images using Feature pyramid network algorithm .
The pose of the human beings are determined by scatter net hybrid deep neural network algorithm which derives a feature from which hierarchical features are developed using principal component analysis and predictions are made
